Put a sitewide password on your site.  Users must enter password before viewing content.

== Description ==
Very simple plug that allows you to put a password-protect the front end of your site.  You can also white list pages so that they are still accessible without entering the site password.  You can also set any page you want to be the \"enter your password\" screen. This is supposed to be a super simple plug, let me know if you want any features added. 


== Installation ==
After downloading the plugin [HERE](https://wordpress.org/plugins/formula04-site-lock/);Â install it by uploading it into your plugin directory or using the built in [WordPress plugin installer](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins).

After activation you will need to go to the Formula04 SiteLock settings page to set a few options.


**Settings Page**

**Formula04 Site Lock Password **

Here is where you set the password your visitors will need to enter in order to login.
**Activate Formula04 Site Lock**

This must be checked in order for Formula04 SiteLock to take effect.
**White Listed Pages** 

These are the pages that will be uneffected by Formula04 SiteLock. Your users will be able to visit these pages whether they are logged in according to Formula04 SiteLock or not.
