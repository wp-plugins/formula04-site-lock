After downloading the plugin [HERE](https://wordpress.org/plugins/formula04-site-lock/);Â install it by uploading it into your plugin directory or using the built in [WordPress plugin installer](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins).

After activation you will need to go to the Formula04 SiteLock settings page to set a few options.




**Settings Page**
== **Formula04 Site Lock Password **- ==

Here is where you set the password your visitors will need to enter in order to login.
== **Activate Formula04 Site Lock** - ==

This must be checked in order for Formula04 SiteLock to take effect.
== **White Listed Pages** - ==

These are the pages that will be uneffected by Formula04 SiteLock. Your users will be able to visit these pages whether they are logged in according to Formula04 SiteLock or not.
== **Formula04 Site Lock Label** - ==

This is the label that will appear directly above the password form.
== ***Formula04 Site Lock Redirection Location**- ==

This determines where a user will be redirected to if they try to view a non-whitelisted page without being logged in.

***Note:** *Whatever page you set this to, you will probably want to include the Formula04 SiteLock password form on it, so your users can log in.([See Usage](http://www.formula04.com/sitelock/usage/)).*
